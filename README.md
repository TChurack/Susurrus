A very simple server-client chat application

At present only allows for a single client to send messages to be displayed at the server.

To run:
* Compile both the client and server classes
* Run the server from the command line: eg. java ChatServer portnumber
* Run the client from a seperate command line (or on a different device): eg. java ChatClient hostname portnumber
* Follow prompts (such as "enter username")
* Type away!
